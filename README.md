# auto-insurance

To run the Jupyter Notebook:

run pip install -r requirements.txt

run jupyter notebook

Then once in the notebook, run all cells.

A file called predicted_target_flag.csv should have appeared.

The variable TARGET_FLAG from test_auto.csv is now populated with Logistic Regression predictions.
